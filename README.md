# randintRickRoll

Congratulations, you've found my stupid program that I made at one in the morning because I was bored. 

This is just a little windows executable that hides in the background and plays rickroll randomly within a 5 minute timespan. It can be spotted and killed in task manager but I uploaded the source code to the source_code branch.

Its not harmful to any computer but because some people get a little frisky, I am not responsible for you, your actions, or anything you
with this program.
